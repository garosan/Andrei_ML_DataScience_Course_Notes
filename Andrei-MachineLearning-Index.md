Machine Learning 101
--------------------

### What is Machine Learning?


### How did we get here

### Types of Machine Learning

You guessed it: 

- Supervised (has labels)
	- Classification
	- Regression
- Unsupervised (doesn't have labels)
	- Clustering
	- Association rule learning
- Reinforcement
	- Skill acquisition
	- Real time learning

### 2nd explanation of ML

input => algorithm => output

input => output => figure out the algorithm

Machine Learning and Data Science framework
-------------------------------------------

### Introducing our framework

1. Data collection
2. Data modelling
3. Deployment

1. Create a framework
2. Match to data science and machine learning tools
3. Make projects

### 6 step Machine Learning framework

1. Problem definition
	- What problem are we trying to solve? Supervised/Unsupervised?
2. Data 
	- What kind of data do we have? Structured/Unstructured?
3. Evaluation
	- What defines success for us?
4. Features
	- What do we already know about the data?
5. Modelling
	- Based on our problem and data, what model should we use?
6. Experimentation
	- How could we improve? What can we try next?

### Types of Machine Learning problems

When shouldn't we use ML?
	- Will a simple hand-coded instruction based system work?

Main types of ML
	- Supervised learning
		- Classification (discrete)
			- Binary classification
			- Multi-class classification
	- Unsupervised learning (continuous)
		- Finding patterns in unsupervised data
		- Clustering
	- Transfer learning
		- Ex. Applying knowledge of cat images recognition to dog images recognition
	- Reinforcement learning
		- Rewards and punishments (generally used for games)
